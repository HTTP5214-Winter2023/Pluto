Will need to research How to do documentation website using Docusaurus. TH eplan for usability testing
is to create a single HTML page environment "get Track information for this song using the JS library. Use the documentation page to help."

A single page, with prompt and text box that looks like code.

Setup Docusaurus for Documentation Reference. Added Getting Started steps and structure for Track, PLaylist, Artist and Podcast Endpoints.

Will need to futher flesh out documentation pages, with examples and Class Definitions.

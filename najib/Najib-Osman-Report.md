This week, I attended a 15 minute group stand-up meeting with my team members. During the meetin, I was the scrum master.
After the stand-up meeting, I began learning how to use the github repositories and how to commit/push work onto github using the command line.
Additionally, I began my resarch on how I wanted to create my sports filter app project for this course. The research was used to explore samples of different API's and
sports filtering apps to generate an idea and design of how i wanted to create my project.

Work: This week i have attended my group stand-up meeting with my other team members. We discussed how the research was going for each group member and what languages
would be used for our projects. I have discussed the langauges I was using which were javascript, html and css, and how my research for my project was going. I started 
to research the different type of sports APIs to use for my project and if it was better to use mulitple sports or just one sport for the filtering.

Work: This week I attended my group stand-up meeting with my other team members. We discussed what each member has done last week for their project, and if 
anything is blocking them from continuing to work. I shared how I have started to code a bit of the html/css for the project but need more time to research.
</br>
Once the meeting was over, i started to research and code a bit of my project for this week's work. I coded the input box for the user favourite team, 
and a drop down list if a user has missed a couple of games. The drop down list will list different games for the user to decide which game they have watched or missed.

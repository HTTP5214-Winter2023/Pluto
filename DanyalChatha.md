# Stand-up log for {Danyal Chatha}

## Jan 20th

Last time, I worked on {was the course introduction and familarizing myself with the course outline}.

Today, I'm going to work on {Creating my git branch and pushing my changes to github}.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:

- Didn't know how to use bash/git commands.
- familiarizing myself on how to push and pull with new cmd.
- confused on how to create a branch

Last time, I worked on {Creating my git branch and pushing my changes to github}.

Today, I'm going to work on {pushing my changes, figuring out what team I belong to or if i can go independent}.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:

- I missed last class due to some unforseen circumstances
- Feel a little bit behind
- don't know if I can do this independent or if I have to join a team.

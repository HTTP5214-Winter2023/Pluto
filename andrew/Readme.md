* This Project is a mix of get started documentation for Midi controller setup with the Logic X recording software
program, along with some code examples with alterable parameters.

* Meeting notes records stored in 'Meeting-Notes-Journal'.

* There are a set of updated instructions (revised instructions) in the Documentation folder.

* A good place to get started with parameter manipulation are the chord definitions in the guitar strummer js file.
The numbers represent notes on a keyboard ie: C25Ã¥

Andrew Barker's repo clone and branch for Http 5214.

# Stand-up log for Andrew Barker

## Jan 18th

Last time, I worked on brainstorming and researching project ideas. Coding js in logic x, 
and learning max msp. All for the purpose of learning to make music in programming

Today, I'm going to work on figuring github stuff out.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:

- had trouble with creating my own branch, but figured it out.

Feb 15, 2023 Retrospective

The github repo is not effective, the current setup will cause issues when merging into a single main branch in the future

currently, there is a single repo and README, that everyone is editing and updating, on individual branch
will need to restructure to account for future merging
create a main README that will act as the team meeting
create individual work folders that wewill place our individual work into
place README in each folder, which will be individual notes
create branches off of main and only put our work in OUR folder
protect the github main branch from being modified
The KANBAN Trello board is not being used, feature tracking is not available

will need to identify features to add to the board

## Standup

- Scrum master Danyal
- Gajendra took notes.
- Watched a youtube vid getting started coding. figured out how to engage the plugin.
- brainstorm new ideas with mousepad as interactive tool, not sure if ill get there for this project
but im going to look into it more.




# Feb 22

- I took notes.
- We started a kanban board and each added some stickies/tasks.
- would like to start coding, but alas...more busy work.
- had a meeting. Start putting docs together and organizing for report due on friday.

Group notes:

Gajendra:  Recently I am working on refining the CSS sector and JavaScript part . And my Blocking is: Having issue with transmitting data to users. But for this I am taking notes /researching to fix the bugs.

Danyal: Restarted coding because didnt like what he had. Looking to add cookies, andneeds to research how.

Najib: Trying to find api for missed games and find access.

Shavin: Has some basic api enpoints, but wants to choose and connect some more specific endpoints. 
ants to add authentication.

Anurag: For webscraping, trying to find a way to bypass security that is restricing his access.

Andrew: Thinking of future possibilities, how to have the mouse pad as an interactive tool. will gear experiments in that direction once
ive gained some more basic experience.

# Mar 8

- Anurag was scrum master.
- Najib was note taker.

I've started coding a little, and have been opening default presets and modifying the code to see what happens.
Trying to get set up with a midi controller that can control my functions.
Having some blocking problems in that the midi controller is not communication as predicted with logic x, but have an alternate plan (and youtube tutorials).


# Mar 15

- Andrew Scrum master.
- Gajendra Note Taker.

I'm kind of stuck, and this project is at the bottom of the priority pile. 
It's the fun one, that get pushed aside for more pressing projects.
If i can get the keyboard synced with the scripter plug in parameters, that will be good. That way, 
users testers can turn knobs and see what happens. Tempted to tell chatgpt "write a simple javascript script that can
manipulate pitch" and see what it spits out.

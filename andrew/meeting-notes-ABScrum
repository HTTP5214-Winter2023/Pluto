# Stand-up log for Andrew Barker

## Jan 18th

Last time, I worked on brainstorming and researching project ideas. Coding js in logic x, 
and learning max msp. All for the purpose of learning to make music in programming

Today, I'm going to work on figuring github stuff out.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:

- had trouble with creating my own branch, but figured it out.

## Feb 8

-scrum master standup Gajendra
-Shavin took notes
-personal goals are to start coding.
-discussed idea with a senior dev last week, Avi Granite, and he
gave me some ideas for where to start
-major blocker is confusion around when and where we will actually be doing some coding
format of class, and the expectations on us difficult to stay on top of.
-reorganizing git folder system - individual folders in main, so when we all merge we wont have conflicts.
will keep individual notes, but keep a common stand-up log.

Logic x js Scripter Plugin setup and preliminary coding


* Scenario 

- a tool for making individual plug ins for making and/or manipulating sounds, and music.
- Laptop with midi controller set up. 
- Tell user basics of how it works, and which knobs/keys they can interact with.
- Let them experiment and use different keys, whatever features they would like.


* Participants 

- Danyal Chatha
- Najib Osman
- Ka Wing (Wingo) Chan 
- Mary Louise Anhance Abrena 
- Kee-Fung (Anthony) Ho


* Instructions - list of instructions for user testing.


Steps to sync midi controller to the Logic X scripter Plugin Parameters

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preliminary - You must have a midi track with some midi information on it, and a plugin on the channel. 
Have a midi controller (or similar device) hooked up to the computer.

Explain to user what the idea is, and what its possible applications can be. Give example of chord definition
alteration.

Comment that it isnt as intimidating as it appears and that I will do a demonstration, and offer assistance navigating the
Logic UI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are intructions to map a midi controller to the scripter parameters. An image is also provided outlining
the steps.

* Begin with users watching tester demonstrate the steps.

* Step 1 - Open a scripter plugin on a midi track with information (under midi fx plugin dropdown)

* Step 2 - Select the preset 'MIDI to plugin parameters'.

* Step 3 - Select 'modulation wheel' for Input Type. (this can be set to whatever you like, but modulation wheel is
an intuitive place to start).

* Step 4 - Set Target 1 to 'Learn Plugin Parameter'.

* Step 5 - Touch and alter your choice parameter on the channel strip plugin.

* Step 6 - Test if patching worked, and play around wit effect.

* Step 7 (optional) - Analyze and edit javascript code. Demonstration of code alteration.

* Step 8 - Repeat Step 4 - 6 with Target 2, and repeat as desired.

Logic Scripter Setup and basic use User Feedback

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Danyal Chatha -

User followed instructions quite easily after demonstration. Needed some assistence when finding window for grabbing
desired parameter. Commented that he liked the interactive element.

* Likes - Fun, and liked that it was interactive.

* Dislikes - Slightly overwhelming first-time users.

* Recommendations - Video tutorial

* Questions -

(Notes taken by Danyal Chatha)

Click scripter, The user changed the factory default to MDI plugin parameters.
The user clicked target 1 and changed it to Tape Delay.
The user selects a parameter and synced with the keyboard User selects target 2 and changes it to tape delay | stereo spread The user is now making music with the AKAI MPK mini and the sounds coming from the laptop.
Users  know changing the different analog bass with the parameters

* Likes - Thought was cool.

* Dislikes - Steep learning curve for people inexperienced with logic interface.

* Recommendations - Suggests debug, maybe a video tutorial.

* Questions - No questions.

- Ka Wing (Wingo) Chan -

Opened scripter, wasn't sure where to click at first. Got faster after quick demonstration. 
Moved through steps and set up three parameters/targets. Asked if tool/knob could be different, and tester demonstrated
how to change control knob.  User played around with settings and had some fun.

* Likes - Thought was cool and fun.

* Dislikes - Difficult to get oriented at first.

* Recommendations - Written portion of instructions more spaced and and detailed.

* Questions - No questions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mary Louise Anhance Abrena -

User was eager to try. Asked for more detailed explaination of what the point of the project was. Tester gave more detailed 
demonstration of js parameter manipulation.
User commented she could see many possible uses.
User navigated steps with some assistence from the tester. Was able to get faster at process setting sequential targets.
User completed all steps.
User played around with UI and had some fun.

* Likes - Fun and interactive. Liked open for lots of different uses. Visual guide to steps was a good feature.

* Dislikes - Learning curve steep for inexperienced user. Instruction steps could be broken down further and expanded.

* Recommendations - Put each step on own page with its own corresponding image.

* Questions - What does it do (asked before starting), what are the future possibilities?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Kee-Fung (Anthony) Ho -

Anthony was eager to try, and requested to be a user. Was a little daunted by interface, as wasnt familiar with logix pro.
Followed along with demonstration, and completed task with a little help as to where to start (midi selector to scripter plugin).
User Completed all steps, and played around with the controls.

* Likes - Thought was fun. As a non-musician wasn't 100% sure of plugins parameters. Understood how parameters could be changed 
in js to alter results.

* Dislikes - initial learning curve, not applicable to people unfamiliar with logix pro.

* Recommendations - thought an interesting idea, and encouraged to keep exploring possiblities.

* Questions - No questions.



--------------------------------------------------- Conclusions ----------------------------------------------------------


* Perhaps continue future testing with same group as they are now familiar with basics.

* Have instructions more spaced out with different images for each step.

* More preamble about setup and possible uses.

* Continue into more js manipulation, and writing own code snippets.

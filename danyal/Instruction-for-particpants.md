# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER TESTING.


* Tell participants the descriptions and objectives of this application
   * “The application was created for me and my dad to keep track of our record against each other and be able to use it more than one time even after closing the application the record will be saved due to the cookies provided”
* 
* Open the application on my laptop for participants to use.
* 
* After participants are done using the application tell them to write their review of the application on my GitHub file called “user-review.md” so I don’t contaminate their review with my interaction of what they are saying
* 
* The user-review.md file will have all the questions about what they like, dislike and recommend for the application that I showed them.

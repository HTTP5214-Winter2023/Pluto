This was our first standup meeting. Danyal brainstormed and came up with a chess tracking idea. He is now working on researching how to implement cookies in his code to improve the user experience.

Shavin is currently researching what platform he wants to use for his project, and is leaning towards using the Spotify API. He has also started adding some basic API endpoints and is looking to choose and connect more specific endpoints.

Najib is researching and deciding whether he wants to track multiple sports or just focus on one. He is also looking for an API that provides access to missed games.

I am working on wireframing and researching how to develop a one-time password web application.So, I am also leaning towards making the OTP web app.

Our team had a standup meeting named Pluto, led by Shavin, and documented at https://github.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/Team-Pluto. Andrew took the notes during the meeting.

Throughout this week, I was focused on improving the authentication process by switching to a one-time password authorization method. Additionally, I spent some time building out the HTML and JS components of the project.

Danyal, on the other hand, spent most of his time researching possible solutions to fix an error he encountered with CSS. He has not yet started development but has made progress in creating the HTML, CSS, and JS structures for the project. His next step is to build logic that can effectively compare tally points.

Shavin's main task was to research the various uses of the Spotify API, but unfortunately, he's currently blocked. In order to make progress, Shavin's next step is to conduct user research to identify the specific needs of the project and how Spotify's API could be integrated effectively.

Andrew was focused on learning the logic coding environment this week but has encountered some roadblocks along the way. He is now blocked and his next step is to work on getting a script up and running to make further progress.

Najib is working on the sport team tracker and has made great progress on the HTML and CSS components of the project. However, he is currently blocked on research and will shift his focus to making progress in HTML and CSS for the time being. You can find his work on the project at https://github.com/HTTP5214.

Our team met for our standup meeting named Pluto, which was led by myself as the Scrum Master. Shavin took on the responsibility of note taker for this meeting, and we documented our progress on https://github.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/Team-Pluto.

This week, our team had a number of productive meetings to discuss progress on our various projects. The first meeting, which we called Pluto, was led by our Scrum Master, Danyal, and I was the note taker.

During this meeting, we discussed the work we had each been doing over the past week. Specifically, I had been working in detail with CSS and doing research to fix an error. Danyal had been working on coding with JavaScript and doing some research to fix the logic. Shavin had just started working on the project, so he didn't have any blocking issues yet, and was ready to dive in. Andrew had been working on the project and making good progress, and Najib was working on the HTML and CSS part of the project and didn't have any blocking issues.

In addition to discussing our individual projects, we talked about how we could work together more effectively as a team. One thing we agreed on was the importance of good communication, both in terms of keeping each other updated on our progress and also in terms of asking for help when we need it. Danyal suggested that we start doing daily stand-up meetings to keep everyone in the loop, and we all agreed that this was a good idea.

After the Pluto meeting, Danyal and I had a one-on-one session where we discussed his next steps as a Scrum Master. He talked about his plans to focus more on improving our processes and ensuring that we are following Scrum best practices. We also talked about some of the challenges he has been facing in this role, and I suggested a few things he could try to help address these challenges.

Overall, it was a productive week for our team and we made good progress on our various projects. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can accomplish next week.

As the Scrum Master, Shavin led our team's latest meeting where we started a kanban board to track our tasks. Andrew documented the notes from this meeting. We all contributed tasks to the board and discussed how to organize our work for a report that is due on Friday.

During this time, I was focused on refining the CSS sector and JavaScript part of our project. However, I was blocked by an issue with transmitting data to users. To fix this, I began taking notes and conducting research.

Danyal restarted coding because they weren't satisfied with their previous work. They are now looking to add cookies and need to conduct further research to do so.

Najib is working on finding an API for missed games and finding access. This is proving to be challenging, but they are continuing to work on it.

Shavin has some basic API endpoints set up, but they want to choose and connect more specific endpoints. They also want to add authentication to the project.

Anurag is working on web scraping, but is having trouble bypassing security measures that are restricting their access. They are currently researching ways to overcome this obstacle.

Andrew is thinking about future possibilities for the project and considering how to incorporate the mouse pad as an interactive tool. They plan to experiment in this direction once they gain more basic experience.
